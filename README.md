A simple project on Proof of Delivery by using Rest API Authentication with Laravel Passport and User ACL based on Roles and Permissions in Laravel 5.7.

Proof of delivery (POD) is a method to establish the fact that the recipient received the contents sent by the sender. A project in Laravel 5.7 to Manage the Outbound, Inbound, Invoice, Checker, Driver, Assistant, Vehicle and Reports.

A guideline to use this –

1. Clone the repository with git clone
2. Copy .env.example file to .env and edit database credentials there
3. Run composer install
4. Run php artisan key:generate
5. Run php artisan migrate
6. Run Seed
7. Create Roles and Permissions
8. Create Users with multiple roles and permissions.
9. Then you can control routes/view files with roles and permissions.


Thank You.... :)

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable, creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel attempts to take the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in the majority of web projects, such as authentication, routing, sessions, queueing, and caching.

Laravel is accessible, yet powerful, providing tools needed for large, robust applications. A superb inversion of control container, expressive migration system, and tightly integrated unit testing support give you the tools you need to build any application with which you are tasked.
